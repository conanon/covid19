9 Blunders that Give the Covid Plandemic Away

【1】US CDC predicted this plague earlier than Bill Gates.



You probably have heard that Bill Gates held the meeting Event 201 and invited the head of Chinese CDC, Dr Gao, discussed about the coming pandemic flu in 2019. But two months earlier than Bill Gates, US CDC held an public exercise called "Crimson Contagion" assuming a "pandemic flu erupted in China" on Aug 13th, at Atlanta Center:

【2】Media won't tell which Chinese learned to make viruses, and from whom.

Yes you know Dr.Shi, who works at Wuhan virus lab till today. But did they ever mention her full name? Or the essay she and 13 other authors from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, published in a 2015 Nature?

There was another crucial Chinese, who was even more experienced than her, caught mailing something back to China from the Canadian only level 4 biolab. She won the "Governor General's Innovation Awards" from Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory for developing the Ebola vaccine. She has been jailed under the charge "Espionage" and "Threat to National Security''. Frank Plummer, her teacher and the founder of that lab, died of acute heart attack in Feb 2020.

【3】Every US Influentials kept silent on its severeness

To support Democrat, Bob Woodward Leaked that President Trump told him as early as February 7th that the virus was airborne and really deadly. However, both chose to keep silent until fall, the election season.

So Anthony Fauci was not alone.And ironically, as President Trump confessed, that airborne virus intelligence was nothing secret, it was published by the Chinese government, as the 5th whitebook of covid-19:

【4】The West Leaders were sure that the disease won't get Whites

President Trump was very confident in know-how of the new virus at least till March 6, 2020.

He sounded like a joke, but the top official of CDC, Dr. Redfield did not correct him or add a word.

And the Italian Financial Prime Minister told the Japanese Financial Prime Minister Taro Aso it was the illness of the yellow race and it is none of their business in late Feb at the G7 meeting. It was leaked at the conference of Japan Parliament on March 24 and the original twitter and clip got censored. Here is a citation in Taiwan media

【5】Trump and CDC blamed China for hiding details of the virus

On Mar 23rd, President Trump stressed that he did not know about the virus, and the Chinese government should have been more transparent to allow US virologists to go inside Wuhan Lab to check everything, which could have saved lots of lives (in US).

He was referring to the event Dr Gao from Chinese CDC telephoned Dr Redfield and told how bad it was on Jan 6th, but did not reply as the latter offered a team into Wuhan:

【6】The covid-19 were actually 3 viruses, and the Wuhan one never got viral outside Asians

In April, the Foster Brothers and their friends published an analysis on all the covid19 genomes submitted so far with mathematics, and distinguished 3 families. "Wuhan's major virus type, 'B', was prevalent in patients from across East Asia. However, the variant didn't travel much beyond the region without further mutations"

[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200409085644.htm]

If B was the virus for East Asians, and A was stolen by Dr Qiu from Canada, questions remain that where did C came from and how did A go from China to US as the border has been shut since Jan 31st?

【7】After Italy was flooded by covid-C, probably from Iran, UK announced herd immunity plan

As of 29 February，Iran government has reported "593 confirmed cases and 43 deaths"
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Iran]

And Italy was hit hard after the Iranians, there is no announcement yet that if the dominating virus in Iran was the same C subtype viral in Iran. But the Italian government realized that it was not just the disease for Asians and they asked for help from the Chinese, who sent a team on March 10th.

Despite all the panics in Iran and in Italy and in South Europe, the UK announced the "Herd Immunity" plan on March 17th. Were they sure that the virus that hit brunette won't get them?

【8】Japan took loose measures as South Korea, but were not hit hard (except for Shinzo Abe)

After the Chinese submitted the genomes on Jan 10th, German scientists came up with accurate genome test kit on Jan 17th, which South Korea president learned and quickly offered to all citizens:

South Korea did play a perfect defense because they acted with WHO. But the US CDC banned this testkit before March 6th, providing few PCR test kits instead.

On contrast, Japan did not allow mass test on covid 19, their criteria was fever above 37.5 degrees Celcius and had been to the infected area in 14 days till getting sympton.

Despite insufficient tests, Japan seemed to cope with the virus pretty well. Wait, the official responsible for bringing back the expats to Wuhan fell dead as soon as arriving home:

So was Shinzo Abe assasinated really by a mad man?

【9】2012 London Olympics prophecied this plague, even Boris Johnson hospitalized

Among the demons were a giant like Boris Johnson on a hospital bed, and a giant like Dr. Fauci with a magic wand. But why did the knights with corona umbrellas defeat the demons in the end? It is called subliminal message, to help you welcome the coronavirus, in the same disaster scenario.

-----------------------------
Their full plan was just like the movie "Snowpiercer" - Both the guardians and the rebels are needed to form a war to reduce population, just as the destroyed "Georgia Guide Stone" described, or the paintings in Denver Airport predicted. In fact, it was just the beginning of the "Anglo-Saxon Mission" - they wanted to start a cold war with the US almost intact but China and the European Continent in a mess.
