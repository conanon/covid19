The real history that they hide from the people on covid plandemic

Despite that community of biology asserted that this covid-19 coronavirus originated purely from the nature. Many journalists, politicians and even scientists doubt it was an intentional bio-attack.

This article aims to open the eyes of common people without sophisticated viology knowledge to the real and uncensored past news across the globe, to get a whole picture of what really occured, rather than a story with bias instilled by media.

You probably has heard the story of "Bat Woman" Zheng-li Shi in Wuhan biolab, let us begin from her notorious article, shall we?

【1】In 2015, Dr Zheng-Li Shi ranked the 13th author on Nature article - 
"A SARS-like cluster of circulating bat coronaviruses shows potential for human emergence" [https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3985]

> Wait, she was not the leading virologist in thie research? Correct - she was not even in the topten! The leading guy was Vineet D Menachery, who is currently working at Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. And the last author Dr Baric also worked in UNC!

> So what made the UNC guys to cooperate a poor Chinese doctor on the other end of world who could only catch bats in remote Chinese caves? To study how to genetically modify a coronavirus that could only infect bats to that could infect humans? In order to prepare for that dangerous virus ahead of nature and research drugs and vaccines for it?

【2】On July 5th 2019, another Chinese viologist Dr Xiang-Guo Qiu, working at the only level-4 biolab in Canada, got caught by Canadian secret agents, at the charge of "espionage" and "a threat to national security". This foreign employee who had contributed to invent the first vaccine for Ebola virus on this planet, is still prisoned in somewhere the public has no idea of.

> If you were watch the CBC News, in January and Feburary of 2020, it did mention this old news and suspected Dr Qiu stole something from that lab that could cause the bioweapon leak from Wuhan lab. And these reports got deleted of course. But the question remains - what could she steal from that lab for China that constitute a threat to "national security" and could not get an open trial? Definitely not another vaccine against existing natural virus like Ebola, right?

【3】On Aug 19th, the CDC center in Atlanta, was ending an Exercise called "Crimson Contagion" across the United States for months. The premise was a noval flu-like virus that originated from Sichuan Province of China swept across the globe by flights and other transformation means. So the US CDC did prepare for such a crisis, half a year before hand.

There are 40 events that were actual news and findings published in the public media. Check the doc file 'Covid-19 Chronicles...' for details. In case of deletion of important videos from platforms (which already happened to a few of them) downloaded videoclips as well as pictures are also stored.
